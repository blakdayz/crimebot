A bot designed to come up with, create, articulate, and even to do the crime so you don't do the time. (For entertainment purposes only)

**What's Included**

The CrimeBOT project is a comprehensive toolset for simulating and analyzing various aspects of cybercrime. The following modules are included:

* **Chatbot**: A text-based interface for interacting with the CrimeBOT model. Users can input queries and receive responses, including campaign advice, infrastructure guidance, and more.
* **Malware Generation**: A module for generating malware code samples. This includes writing python malware to perform specific tasks such as ransomware, C2 backdoor Client, or C2 Server.
* **Network Scanning**: A module for scanning networks and identifying potential vulnerabilities. This includes detecting Wi-Fi access points, tracking network traffic, and more.
* **Voice Services**: A module for generating spoken responses to user input. This includes text-to-speech (TTS) functionality and voice recording.
* **Hybrid Computing**: A module for performing complex computations using quaternions. This includes generating quaternion keys, encoding messages as quaternions, and more.
* **Card Games**: A module for simulating card games using a custom tarot deck. This includes providing  advice and suggesting actions within a campaign
* **Obfuscation**: A module for obfuscating and encrypting malware code samples. This includes generating pyc files, embedding keys in images, and more.
* **Quaternions**: A module for working with quaternions, including generating quaternion keys, encoding messages as quaternions, and more.
* **Docker**: A module for managing Docker containers. This includes starting and stopping containers, installing tools, and more.
